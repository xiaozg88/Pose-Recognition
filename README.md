Current motion detection and evaluation technologies encounter challenges including limited scalability, imprecise feedback, and absence of personalized guidance. To tackle these challenges, this study integrates the efficient BlazePose technology with the pioneering DW_KNN* algorithm, resulting in a remarkable 98.2% accuracy in action recognition and showcasing outstanding scalability. Furthermore, the established ACLstm time series prediction model can comprehensively analyze usersâ€™ historical sports data and associated factors. In the Rehab dataset, the MAE loss for Motion Count is 1.383, while for Motion Time it is 0.508. This innovative framework delivers precise feedback and tailored guidance for physical exercise and medical rehabilitation.
